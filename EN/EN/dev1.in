When
I
called
this
morning
,
I
didn't
think
I
would
be
able
to
get
in
at
12
,
but
I
was
able
to
get
in
,
along
with
four
other
guests
.

The
tuna
and
wasabe
potatoes
are
excellent
.

My
favortie
pizza
joint
in
Seattle

Food
wise
,
its
ok
but
a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
considering
the
restaurant
isn't
a
fancy
place
.
