Food B-neutral
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place B-positive
. I-positive

– O
tucked B-negative
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly B-negative
Center I-negative

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards B-negative
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature B-negative
? O
MSG O

taste O
lingering B-negative
in O
my O
throat B-negative
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O

there O
before O
8p B-negative

on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs B-negative

it O
easier B-negative
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi B-positive
bar I-positive

The O
wine B-positive

reminds I-positive
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O

It O
was O

This O

a O
mind-bogglingly B-negative

I O
went O
here O

we O
went O
someplace B-negative

We O
concluded B-negative
with O
tiramisu O

I O
wish O
this O

enough O

it O
to O

addressed B-negative
by O

but O
Snooze O

people O
climbing B-negative
over O
each O

a O
chance O

eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O

so O
this O

The O
